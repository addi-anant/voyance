I'm proud of this project because it was my first personal project that I completed without following an end-to-end tutorial. I started from Frontend Design and went all the way to API and Backend Design, leveraging the knowledge gained from my previous projects while learning the MERN stack. This experience taught me to solve my own doubts and errors, greatly enhancing my development skills. To take the project a step further, I added Shimmer UI, optimized the bundle for improved performance, and deployed it on Vercel (Frontend) and Azure (Backend).

** NOTE: As the Backend is deployed on a free-tier Azure Machine, the backend may take 1-2 minutes for an initial response (as according to Azure free-tier policy, it temporarily shuts down the API when not in use).
